# ML Pipeline on BraVL Dataset

This repository accompanies a short 5-page paper presenting an **end-to-end machine learning pipeline** on the **BraVL dataset**.  
It covers the full workflow from dataset exploration to custom model design and evaluation.

## Pipeline Overview
1. **Comprehensive Dataset Exploration** – analysis of BraVL data distribution, features, and challenges.  
2. **Paradigm Design & Data Splitting** – task setup and robust train/validation/test separation.  
3. **Custom Model Implementation** – tailored architectures for BraVL.  
4. **Result Analysis & Visualization** – evaluation with interpretable performance metrics and plots.
